  abstract     = {The effect of temperature on the elastic properties of woven-glass epoxy substrates for printed circuit board applications was investigated. Three common commercially pressed boards (1080, 2116, and 7628 woven-glass fabrics and FR4 epoxy) were used for this study. The elastic properties were identified by means of a combined theoretical and experimental vibration method. Vibration experiments were performed under reduced air pressure to reduce the influence of mass, stiffness, and damping of the surrounding air and inside an environmental chamber with varying temperature and constant humidity. Above the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the epoxy, the in-plane shear moduli (G 12) were decreased by 33-37% and the out-of-plane shear moduli (G 13 , G 23) were decreased by 48%, whereas the Young's moduli in the warp (E 1) and fill (E 2) directions were much less affected.},

Some applications require ambient air temperature measurements while others need to measure the temperature of a nearby component on the PCB. Measuring ambient air temperature with a surface mount technology (SMT) device is challenging due to the thermal influence of other components within the system. In other systems, in which the temperature of a component needs to be measured, ambient air temperature can influence and degrade the measurement accuracy. The system designer needs to make certain design decisions regarding both package type and PCB layout when integrating a temperature sensor. This application note provides recommendations to system designers and explains methods for improving the accuracy of the temperature point being measured. The Recommendations are provided both for air temperature measurements and for component temperature measurement. The report details layout techniques, device orientation, and best practices for mounting.},

  abstract    = {Many high-performance systems rely on accurate temperature measurements to optimize performance and ensure reliable operation. The temperature readings can be used to adjust temperature-sensitive elements, such as A/D converters and high-end displays, or the readings may be used to monitor system health and prevent overheating. While modern processors have built-in temperature measurement, these are generally not as accurate as an external temperature sensor and overall system performance may suffer if an external sensor is not used. As system density increases, the use of external sensors that measure many temperature points also help simplify the system design for thermal management design. This application report discusses the design considerations for successfully sensing the temperature of a highly integrated system using a digital remote temperature sensor. The application report specifically focuses on the TMP468, but the information can be applied to other digital remote temperature sensors such as the TMP431, TMP451, and TMP461. Remote temperature sensors sense the junction temperature of either a NPN or PNP bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The BJT can be an integrated transistor in a MCU, GPU, ASIC, FPGA, or a discrete transistor such as the common 2N3904 NPN transistor or 2N3906 PNP transistor. The use of remote temperature sensors is common in telecom equipment (switches and routers), servers, automotive infotainment, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), and high-end displays. System design can be quite challenging in highly integrated systems because noise and BJT process variations can cause errors. This application report gives an overview of remote temperature sensors, discusses error sources, and shows how to mitigate system impact of sensor errors. Layout considerations are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Low-cost wireless temperature measurement has significant value in the food industry, logistics, agriculture, portable medical equipment, intelligent wireless health monitoring, and many areas in everyday life. A wireless passive temperature sensor based on PCB (Printed Circuit Board) materials is reported in this paper. The advantages of the sensor include simple mechanical structure, convenient processing, low-cost, and easiness in integration. The temperature-sensitive structure of the sensor is a dielectric-loaded resonant cavity, consisting of the PCB substrate. The sensitive structure also integrates a patch antenna for the transmission of temperature signals. The temperature sensing mechanism of the sensor is the dielectric constant of the PCB substrate changes with temperature, which causes the resonant frequency variation of the resonator. Then the temperature can be measured by detecting the changes in the sensor's working frequency. The PCB-based wireless passive temperature sensor prototype is prepared through theoretical design, parameter analysis, software simulation, and experimental testing. The high-and low-temperature sensing performance of the sensor is tested, respectively. The resonant frequency decreases from 2.434 GHz to 2.379 GHz as the temperature increases from −40 • C to 125 • C. The fitting curve proves that the experimental data have good linearity. Three repetitive tests proved that the sensor possess well repeatability. The average sensitivity is 347.45 KHz/ • C from repetitive measurements conducted three times. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the PCB-based wireless passive sensor, which provides a low-cost temperature sensing solution for everyday life, modern agriculture, thriving intelligent health devices, and so on, and also enriches PCB product lines and applications.},

Heating in ICs due to various reasons which may lead to degradation of performance and can cause serious hazardous effects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). Thermal image processing is one of the best non-contact, non-invasive method which can be used for IC fault detection. The paper aims towards detection of faulty ICs in PCB with help of thermal imaging camera and image processing techniques. Thermal images of sequence detector circuit for different fault conditions are collected. Image matching is achieved by comparing features of training images and test image using Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm. The system will indicate image belongs to particular fault class. The proposed method detects and classify possible faulty IC conditions with improved accuracy and can also help in early prevention remotely before complete circuit failure.},

  abstract     = {Failures in electronic products are often attributable to various combinations, intensities, and durations of environmental loads, such as temperature, humidity, vibration, and radiation. For many of the failure mechanisms in electronic products, there are models that relate environmental loads to the time to failure of the product. Thus, by monitoring the environment of a product over its life cycle, it may be possible to determine the amount of damage induced by various loads and predict when the product might fail. This paper describes the development of a physics-of-failurebased methodology for determining the damage or life consumption in a product. As a demonstration of the methodology, a data recorder has been used to monitor the temperature and vibration loads on a printed circuit board placed under the hood of a car. The data collected by the recorder has been used to determine the life consumption in the solder joints of the printed circuit board due to temperature and vibration loading. The calculated remaining life has then been compared with temperature cycling test results on the board to assess the validity of the approach.},

  abstract     = {As the environmental concern is being raised over residues of lead, the trend of transferring from the conventional lead-based soldering to lead-free soldering is overwhelming. Lead-free solders require the peak temperature to be about 30 degrees Celsius higher than lead-based solders, which induce a narrower margin between the highest melting temperatures of lead-free solders and the heat-resistant temperatures of electronic components. As a result, the accuracy of temperature control of reflow systems needs to meet a higher standard to maintain the solder quality. Whereas, the conventional control process of the onboard temperature is open-loop, which cannot achieve the required accuracy. A closed-loop method by using an array of thermal image cameras for temperature monitoring is too expensive. In order to provide a low-cost and accurate temperature control solution for reflow systems, a cost-effective non-contact temperature approximation and control system is proposed in this article. The proposed temperature approximation is achieved based on a machine learning method with multiple-input single-output strategies to get a relationship between the temperatures near the PCBs and the onboard temperature. The proposed system controls the temperature in a real-time fuzzy logic algorithm to achieve a more accurate control result. The experiment results reveal the feasibility of the proposed temperature approximation and control system. INDEX TERMS Control systems, automation, temperature measurement, temperature control.},

To describe the state-of-the-art of DT-driven CM, this paper delivers a systematic review on the theoretical and practical development of DT in advancing CM. The evolution of concepts, main research areas, applied domains, and related key technologies are summarised. The driver of DT for CM is detailed in three aspects: data support, capability enhancement, and maintenance mode shift. The implementation process of DT-driven CM is introduced from the classification of DT modelling and the extension of monitoring algorithms. Finally, current challenges and opportunities for future research are discussed especially concerning the barriers and gaps in data management, high-fidelity modelling, behavior characterisation, framework standardisation, and uncertainty quantification.},
